## Causal drivers of inter-annual variability in Global TWS change
Terrestrial water storage (TWS) has come out as an important hydro-climate variable to understand the changes in the terrestrial water cycle of a region. Though much emphasis has been on the seasonal changes in TWS, it is the inter-annual change which affects the water availability in a region. In this work, we explore the drivers of this inter-annual variability in TWS through a Causal-Discovery framework, to evaluate climate controls on it.
